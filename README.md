My name is Nabeel Sheikh and I am a Big Data Engineer with Business Intelligence skills. 

Though my designation at CoreLogic is Big Data Quality Engineer, my scope of works exceeds that. I have been the Quality Assurance Subject Matter Expert on a very intriguing and complex project during my career at CoreLogic. It has been a great experience working with various technologies, including REST API, GCP and Elasticsearch. I collaborate with Product Owners, Architects, Developers, and other Stakeholders, through all phases of the product lifecycle in an Agile methodology, to design, build and manage the QA regression suite and framework. I find that my passion to grow and learn always lead me to new and challenging initiatives. 

In my last job, for 3 years I performed ETL and analyzed Big Data to implement cost saving strategies while optimizing efficiency and quality. I have a proven background in effectively communicating relevant data into business insight, using in house BI tools, for management to promote informed decision-making. I have strong communication and interpersonal skills, as well as a sound technical foundation in Python, SQL (Postgres), NoSQL (MongoDB) and data visualizations. I completed the Data Analytics boot camp at University of California-Irvine in 2020 which enhanced my skillset and helped me develop new ones. I learned front-end web development tools, such as Bootstrap and various JavaScript libraries, as well as numerous cloud services, including AWS and Microsoft Azure.

I strongly believe that the world is constantly evolving and that requires us to continuously grow as well, otherwise we become outdated. That's why I am always trying to grow by learning new tools and studying popular trends.
