My name is Nabeel Sheikh and I am a Data Engineer with Business Intelligence skills. In my last job, for 3 years I performed ETL and analyzed Big Data to implement cost saving strategies while optimizing efficiency and quality. I have a proven background in effectively communicating relevant data into business insight, using in house BI tools, for management to promote informed decision-making. I have strong communication and interpersonal skills, as well as a sound technical foundation in Python, SQL (Postgres), NoSQL (MongoDB) and data visualizations. Currently I am wrapping up a Data Boot camp at University of California Irvine which has enhanced my skillset and helped me develop new ones, I have learned new data visualization tools such as Plotly, D3, Tableau as well as AWS services. I am currently studying for the AWS Cloud Practicioner Certification.

I strongly believe that the world is constantly evolving and that requires us to continuously grow as well, otherwise we become outdated. That's why I am always trying to grow by learning new tools and studying popular trends. Feel free to connect with me on my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabeel--sheikh/
